##Hand Statistics

##Gitstats

So, in general, some of the stats from gitstats lined up better than others. The
ones that did not line up so well were mainly lines of code and contributors.
The lines of code seems to be because it counts different things as "code".
Based on some of the ridiculous numbers I've seen from gitstats, I think that
it's counting more than it should. The contributors discrepancy is probably
because I used the statistic from Github, and gitstats generated it by looking
at the names on the commits.

##Gource Videos

Here are some Gource videos:

- [MineBot](https://youtu.be/9DnFOsIa49A)
- [MineBot-v2](https://youtu.be/h33p-TYk8Hw)
- [Mole AI](https://youtu.be/-iu2EylbOmQ)
- [Myo-Intelligesture](https://youtu.be/yfyUqnaPn48)

All projects seem to have a leader. In the case of all of them except Module,
it's trivial, because there's only one contributor. In the case of Module, the
leader seems to be Aaron Perl.
