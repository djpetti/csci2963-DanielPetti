# Lab 8

## Bug Summary

For this lab, I submitted [this
bug](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/nutshell.html)
to FreeBSD. It fixes two minor typos in the introductory section of the
handbook. The actual diff of the chapter XML file can be found
[here](docs/chapter.xml.diff).

## Why Maintain Good Documentation?

Despite the fact that your source code is technically available, no sane user is
going to want to dig through it just to figure out how to perform some trivial
task. Therefore, it is important to have some documentation so that new and
experienced users alike can easily figure out how to perform common tasks. The
higher the quality of the documentation, the happier and more productive your
users will be. This in and of itself should be enough of an argument for having
solid documentation.

## Learning Outcomes

Documentation for an open source project is a group effort. In most projects,
however, we see people focusing on code, and kind of leaving documentation by
the wayside. Luckily, FreeBSD bucks this trend: It has very solid documentation
that has been maintained and updated for over a decade. Furthermore, fixing
issues in the documentation is an easy process: Once the issue is found, it
simply needs to be reported. Though this paradigm seems to be rare among
open-source projects, I think that this is one of the best ways to do it.
Otherwise, you will invariably end up with poor documentation and confused
users.
