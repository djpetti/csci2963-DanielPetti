##Definition of Open Source

This is a list of attributes that a particular piece of software must have in
order to be considered "open source". The main takeaway is the following:

- There must not be any restrictions on the use or redistribution of the
  particular software.
- There must not be any restrictions on how the software can be modified by a
  third party.
- Source code must be accessible for free.

##Smart Questions

The point of this guide seems to be that most open-source developers are a
fickle bunch of midly socially challenged people, and asking them questions in a
clear and intelligent manner is more likely to elicit a helpful answer. Some of
the makings of a good question.

- Do your research beforehand and make that clear.
- Be polite, but don't grovel.
- Write with proper spelling and grammar, but avoid superfluousness.
- Make your subject/title something that tells other people with the same
  problem that your question may be helpful to them.

##Free Culture

Chapter 3 is all about piracy. The main argument of the chapter is that piracy
is not necessarily a bad thing, and, in fact, all of the industries today that
are now heavily prosecuting piracy were, in fact, founded upon some form of
piracy initially. Lessig discounts arguments many of the arguments against
piracy, arguing instead that in many cases, the decision between allowing and
outlawing piracy more boils down to whether powerful interests that already
enjoy a monopoly are allowed to extend that monopoly. Furthermore, he argues, by
citing historical precedent, that certain kinds of piracy are often in the
interests of the general public.

I would note that I do not think that Lessig is advocating all forms of piracy,
he is simply arguing against the use of anti-piracy laws to prosecute extremely
minor infractions in a disproportionate way.

##Reflection

So, I'm sure you know already, but my RCOS project is GroBot. This is a small,
modular hydroponics unit intended for home use. Furthermore, it is a
continuation of my IED project. I chose this because I think that the project
has potential, but one semester was not enough to develop it into anything that
is really useful.

As far as contributing to an existing project goes, I'm thinking that I may as
well contribute to something that I use often, such as the Linux kernel, or
Tensorflow. I would like my contributions here to actually make my own life
better. Furthermore, I would like to gain a better understanding of the inner
workings of something that I use all the time.
