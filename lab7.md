## Admissions

So, unfortunately for prospective students, my analysis turned up no obvious
factors that seem to lead to admission, at least not at a significant level.
However, there did seem to be some strong predictors of *not* being admitted.
Particularly, if you had a rank of 4, which was the lowest possible ranking, you
weren't very likely to be admitted. Furthermore, having a bad GRE score seemed
to be fairly detrimental, even if you had a decent rank. Particularly, a score
below 600 was iffy.

Here are some nifty plots:

## Electoral Data

There's not a whole lot of data for this, and I had to discretize it first
before I could do anything useful. The most interesting thing that I found
through this analysis was consistently that a low number of total votes cast
implies that Bush won by a relatively high margin in that state. Given what I
know about American politics, this seems reasonable. Interestingly, I would
expect the opposite association as well, but that didn't really materialize.

## Top Movies

Here are some things I've learned about movies:

- From 1981 - 1996, most movies were in the bottom quintile in terms of
  money made.
- 1996 - 2010 was similar, although the trend was slightly less pronounced.
- Movies that come out in the spring seem to make less money.
- From 1996 to 2010, more movies came out in the fall (30%) than would be
  expected by random chance. (25%)
- Incidentally, movies that come out in the fall seem highly likely to fall into
  the bottom fifth in terms of money made.
